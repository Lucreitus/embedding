# Embedding.js
Embedding is a javascript library that makes it easy to create data-driven environments. It is built on three.js, and takes inspiration from D3.

A major hypothesis driving the development of Embedding is that direct navigation and manipulation of environments provide fundamentally new opportunities in the creation of compelling data visualization, exploration, and discovery experiences - in particular, the ability to directly change the viewpoint via position- and direction-tracked camera in VR.
