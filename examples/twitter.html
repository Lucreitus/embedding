		 * Twitter is the most interesting (semi-)public data stream, but it takes a little work to get access
		 * to it. You can follow these steps to obtain credentials that will enable this example to work:
		 * 
		 * 1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com and create a new app - can have any name, and a fake domain
		 * 2. Change the app's permissions to read-only
		 * 3. Under "Keys and Access Tokens", generate Your Access Token
		 *
		 * You should now be looking at a page that contains a Consumer Key, a Consumer Secret, an Access Token, 
		 * and an Access Token Secret
